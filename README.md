# Holberton Headphones

In this project, we implemented from scratch, without any library, a web page based on a design model given on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gkWRcFqkwtruWZgSfnnHF0/Holberton-School---Headphone-company)

# Goal of the project

Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

# Description and Requirements
In this project:

 - We used all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that we have learned previously.
 - No instructions. We are free to implement it the way we want.
 - The web page must be responsive in order to target: Desktop, Tablet and Mobile users
 - We are not allowed to import any external CSS framework (like bootstrap)
 - We are not allowed to use Javascript

# Best practices to follow
 - reset CSS styling: Normalize your CSS file using [necolas’ normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css) with this [version](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/8.0.1/normalize.min.css.)
 - use variables
 - simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
 - avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
 - simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
 - build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

# Design informations
 - max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
 - the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
 - links hover/active: #FF6565
 - button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
